Markdown2Medium is a minimal website, built with NextJS, that allows you to publish Markdown articles to **medium.com** by using the [public Medium API](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs).

# How it works
1. Go to the [Medium settings page](https://medium.com/me/settings)
2. **Integration tokens** section
3. Give the token a name and press **Get integration token**
4. Copy the token, paste it in **API key input** and press validate
5. You are good to go, write your article and publish it

# Privacy
The entire code is open-source, nothing is stored or logged. Nobody will ever know your token.

# TODO
- Support OAuth Medium authentication
- editor/markdown preview side by side
